# What is Variable Scope?

Variable Scope is a fundamental concept in programming that determines where you can access a variable.

There are two main types of variable scope in Python:

# Global Scope

A variable defined in the global scope is accessible from anywhere in the code, including inside functions. 

Global variables are defined outside of any function at the "top" level of the Python file.

Another way to think about global scope is that the variable declaration is not indented!

```python

x = 10  # Global variable

def print_global():
    print(x)  # Accessing the global variable inside a function
```

print_global()  # Output: 10
```

# Local Scope

A variable defined in the local scope is only accessible within the function where it is defined.

Local variables are created when a function is called and destroyed when the function exits.

```python
def my_function():
    y = 5  # Local variable
    print(y)  # Accessing the local variable inside the function
my_function()  # Output: 5
print(y)  # This will raise an error because y is not defined outside the function
```
