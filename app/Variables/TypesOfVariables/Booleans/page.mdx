# Booleans

## What is a boolean?

A boolean is a data type that can hold one of two values: `True` or `False`.

In Python, booleans are often used to represent whether a **condition** is true. (We'll learn more about **conditions** and how to use them later) For example:

```python
is_raining = True
has_umbrella = False
```

In this example, `is_raining` is a boolean variable that indicates whether it is raining, and `has_umbrella` indicates whether you have an umbrella.

It's raining and we don't have an umbrella! 

## Creating boolean variables

You can create a boolean variable by assigning it either `True` or `False`. Here are some examples:

```python
# Example of boolean variables
is_sunny = True
is_weekend = False
```

You can also create boolean variables based on comparisons. For example:

```python
# Example of boolean variables based on comparisons
age = 20
is_adult = age >= 18  # is_adult will be True because 20 is greater than 18
is_teenager = age < 18  # is_teenager will be False because 20 is not less than 18
```

## Using boolean variables

Refer to the section on [Control Flow](../../../ControlFlow) later in this course to learn how to use boolean variables in your code to make decisions and control the *flow* of your program.

For now just remember that boolean variables can only hold the values `True` or `False`, and they are often used to represent conditions in your code.
