# Variable Types in Python

In Python, variables are dynamically typed, meaning the type of a variable is *inferred* based on the value.
For example, if we create a variable `x` and assign a value of `12` as in the example below:

```python
x =12
```

The type of the variable x is *inferred* to be an **integer** type.

We'll learn about the **integer** type and additional types that variables can be on the next few pages.
