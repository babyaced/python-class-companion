# Variable Types in Python

In Python, variables are **dynamically typed**, meaning the type of a variable is *inferred* based on the value you assign to it.
For example, if we create a variable `x` and assign a value of `12` as in the example below:

```python
x = 12
```

The type of the variable x is *inferred* to be an **integer** type.

Another example: 

```python
x = "the letter x"
```

The type of the variable x is *inferred* to be a **string** type.

We'll learn about the **integer** and **string** type plus some additional types that variables can be on the next few pages.
