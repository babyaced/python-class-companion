# Classes and Objects
Objects are a fundamental data structure in Python and programming in general. 
An object is a collection of related data and functionality.
In Python, everything is an object, including numbers, strings, lists, and even functions.

Objects area are created using **classes**. You can think of a class as a blueprint for creating objects.
A class defines the properties and behaviors that the objects created from it will have.

<Callout type="info" heading="A Note on Terminology">
In Python and other programming languages, when you refer to a function that is part of a class, it is called a <u>method</u>.
</Callout>

## Creating Classes
You can create a class in Python using the `class` keyword.
Here's an example of a simple class that represents a `Dog`:

```python
class Dog:
    species = "Canis familiaris"
    number_of_legs = 4
```
You have now defined a class named `Dog` with two **class variables**: `species` and `number_of_legs`.
Now you can use the class `Dog` to create an object (also called an instance) of that class.
In simpler terms, you can create a new dog with the properties defined in the class:

```python
my_dog = Dog()
```

The my_dog variable now represents a specific dog object with the species "Canis familiaris" and number of legs 4.

What if you wanted to create multiple dogs with different names and ages though?
For that, we will have to learn about constructors and instance variables, which we will cover later.

### Object methods

You can also define functions (methods) inside a class to represent behaviors of the object.
**Methods** are defined just like regular functions, but they are indented inside the class definition.

Here's an example of adding a method to the `Dog` class:

```python
class Dog:
    species = "Canis familiaris"
    number_of_legs = 4

    def bark():
        print("Woof!")
```

We added a `bark` method to the `Dog` class that returns the string "Woof!" when called.

We'll learn how to call methods later, but for now, just know that you can define behaviors for your objects using methods.

## Constructors

Notice that the dog properties I defined in the previous section ,`species` and `number_of_legs`, are the same for all dogs.
I specifically chose those properties because they are common to all dogs.
They make good candidates to be **class variables** because **class variables** are shared across all instances of a class.

No matter how many dogs you create, they will all have the same `species` and `number_of_legs`. Makes sense right?

To create properties that are unique to each object we use **instance variables**.

For a dog, properties we might use **instance variables** for could be its `name` and `age`.

To set up these unique properties, we use something called a **constructor**.

A **constructor** is a special function that is called when an object is created from a class.

We often use a constructor to initialize the unique properties of an object.

In Python, we have to define the constructor function by defining the `__init__` method.

Here's an example of how to use a constructor to create a `Dog` class with unique `name` and `age` properties:

```python
class Dog:
    species = "Canis familiaris"
    number_of_legs = 4

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
```


In this example, we created a constructor by defining the `__init__` method that takes two parameters: `name` and `age`.

The `self` parameter is a reference to the current **instance** of the class and is used to access variables that belong to the class.

Now we can create multiple dog objects with different names and ages:

```python
dog1 = Dog("Buddy", 3)
dog2 = Dog("Max", 5)
```


To use the constructor, we simply write the class name followed by parentheses, passing in the required **arguments**.

In this case, we created two dog objects: `dog1` with the name "Buddy" and age 3, and `dog2` with the name "Max" and age 5.
Each dog object has its own unique `name` and `age` **instance variables**, while still sharing the same `species` and `number_of_legs` **class variables**.

The concept of `self` can be a bit tricky to understand at first.
So let's break down what is happening in the constructor.

When we create a new dog object using `Dog("Buddy", 3)`, 
the `__init__` method is called with `self` referring to the new dog object being created aka its "self".
The `name` of this new Dog object is set to "Buddy", and `age` set to 3.

## Accessing Object properties

Now that we have created our dog objects, we can access their properties using the **dot notation**.

**Dot notation** is a way to access the properties and methods of an object using a dot (`.`) followed by the property or method name.

Here's how we can access the properties of our dog objects:

```python
print(dog1.name)  # Output: Buddy
print(dog1.age)   # Output: 3
print(dog2.name)  # Output: Max
print(dog2.age)   # Output: 5
```

We can also use the `bark` method we defined earlier in this same way with **dot notation**:

```python
dog1.bark()  # Output: Woof!
dog2.bark()  # Output: Woof!
```

Notice that when we call the `bark` method, we use parentheses `()` after the method name to indicate that we are calling a function.

That's it for our introduction to classes and objects in Python!
