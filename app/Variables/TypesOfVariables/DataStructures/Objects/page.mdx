# Classes and Objects

Objects are a fundamental data structure in Python and programming in general. 
An object is a collection of related data and functionality.
In Python, everything is an object, including numbers, strings, lists, and even functions.

Objects are are created using **classes**. You can think of a class as a blueprint for creating objects.
A class defines the properties and behaviors that the objects created from it will have.

## Creating Classes
You can create a class in Python using the `class` keyword.

When you use the `class` keyword you are creating a **class definition**

Here's an example of a simple class that represents a `Dog`:

```python
class Dog:
    species = "Canis familiaris"
    number_of_legs = 4
```
You have now defined a class named `Dog` with two **class variables**: `species` and `number_of_legs`.

### Class Variables

Notice that the dog properties defined in the previous section ,`species` and `number_of_legs`, are the same for all dogs.

They make good candidates to be **class variables** because **class variables** are shared across all instances of a class.

AKA every dog will all have the same `species` and `number_of_legs`.

## Creating an Object using a Class
Now you can use the class `Dog` to create an object (also called an **instance**) of that class.
Basically, you can create a new "Dog" with the species ("Canis familiaris") and number of legs (4) defined in the class:

```python
my_dog = Dog()
```

The my_dog variable now represents a specific dog object with the species "Canis familiaris" and number of legs 4.

We can create as many objects as we want to using this class. 

## Object Methods

You can define functions (methods) inside a class to represent behaviors of the object.
**Methods** are defined just like regular functions, but they are indented inside the class definition.

Here's an example of adding a method to the `Dog` class:

```python
class Dog:
    species = "Canis familiaris"
    number_of_legs = 4

    def bark():
        print("Woof!")
```

We added a `bark` method to the `Dog` class that returns the string "Woof!" when called.

## Accessing Object Properties

An object's **properties** are any variables and methods that are defined in the object's class definition.

Now that we have created our dog objects, we can access their properties using the **dot notation**.

**Dot notation** is a way to access the properties and methods of an object using a dot (`.`) followed by the property or method name.

Here's how we can access the properties of our dog objects:

```python
print(dog1.name)  # Output: Buddy
print(dog1.age)   # Output: 3
print(dog2.name)  # Output: Max
print(dog2.age)   # Output: 5
```

We can also use the `bark` method we defined earlier in this same way with **dot notation**:

```python
dog1.bark()  # Output: Woof!
dog2.bark()  # Output: Woof!
```

Notice that when we call the `bark` method, we use parentheses `()` after the method name to indicate that we are calling a function.
