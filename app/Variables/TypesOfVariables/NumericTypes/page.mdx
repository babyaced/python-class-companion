# Numeric types

Python has several numeric types to represent different kinds of numbers. The most commonly used numeric types are:

- **int**: Represents whole numbers (integers) without a decimal point.
- **float**: Represents real numbers (floating-point numbers) with a decimal point.
- **complex**: Represents complex numbers, which have a real and an imaginary part.

For the most part you will be using **int** and **float** types in your code.

## Integer (int)

An **int** is a whole number without a decimal point. You can create an integer variable like this:

```python
# Example of an integer variable
age = 30
```
In this example, **age** is an integer variable that stores the value **30**.

## Float (float)

A **float** is a number that has a decimal point. You can create a float variable like this:

```python
# Example of a float variable
height = 5.9
```
In this example, **height** is a float variable that stores the value **5.9.


## Performing operations with numeric types

In Python, you can perform various arithmetic operations with numeric types. Here are some examples:

```python
# Addition
a = 10
b = 5
sum = a + b  # sum will be 15

# Subtraction
difference = a - b  # difference will be 5

# Multiplication
product = a * b  # product will be 50

# Division
quotient = a / b  # quotient will be 2.0

# Modulus
remainder = a % b  # remainder will be 0
```

You can also combine different numeric types in operations. For example, adding an **int** and a **float** will result in a **float**:

```python
# Combining int and float
x = 10      # int
y = 2.5     # float
result = x + y  # result will be 12.5 (float)
```

That's a brief overview of numeric types in Python! Next, we'll explore other variable types such as strings and booleans.
