# User Input

User Input is a way for a program to receive data from the user while the program is running.
In Python, we can use the **built-in** `input()` function to get input from the user.

To use the `input()` function, we simply call it and optionally *pass* a string as a prompt to display to the user.

Let's ask the user for their name and then greet them:

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

Here's how this code works:
1. We call the `input()` function with the prompt `"What is your name? "`
2. The program waits for the user to type their name and press Enter.
3. The user's input is then stored in the variable `name` as the input function always returns the entered string.
4. Finally, we print a greeting message that includes the user's name.

You can use the `input()` function to get different types of input from the user as well by using type conversion. 

For example, if you want to get a number from the user, you can convert the input string to an integer using the `int()` function:

```python
ageString = (input("How old are you? ")) # use the input function to get user input and store in ageString variable
age = int(ageString) # convert our ageString variable that is string type to integer type
print("You are " + str(age) + " years old.") # print the message to the user - converting age back to string for concatenation
```
