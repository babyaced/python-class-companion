# Dictionaries

You may be thinking, isn't a dictionary just a list of words and their meanings?
Yes, in real life it is! But in Python, a dictionary is a special data structure that allows you to store data in **key-value pairs**.

**Key-value pairs** means that each item in the dictionary has a unique **key** that is used to access its corresponding **value**.

In fact when you think about it, a real-life dictionary is also made up of key-value pairs, where the **key** is the word and the **value** is its meaning.

We use dictionaries in Python when we want to store and organize data that is related to each other in some way.

Dictionaries are very useful because they allow us to quickly look up values based on their keys, making data retrieval efficient and straightforward.

Let's see how we can create and use dictionaries in Python.

## Creating a dictionary

You can create a dictionary by placing key-value pairs inside curly braces `{}`, separated by commas. Each key is separated from its value by a colon `:`.

Let's create a simple dictionary that represents a person:

```python
person = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York",
    "hair_color": "brown"
}

print(person)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York', 'hair_color': 'brown'}
```

In this example, we created a dictionary named `person` with three key-value pairs:
- The key `"name"` has the value `"Alice"`
- The key `"age"` has the value `30`
- The key `"city"` has the value `"New York"`

Remember that keys must be unique within a dictionary.

If we tried to create another key `"name"` in the same dictionary, it would overwrite the previous value.

```python
person = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York",
    "hair_color": "brown",
    "name": "Aly"  # This will overwrite the previous "name" key
}

print(person)  # Output: {'name': 'Aly', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York', 'hair_color': 'brown'}
```

As you can see, the value for the key `"name"` is now `"Aly"` because it overwrote the previous value.

Values, on the other hand, can be of any data type and can be duplicated.

if we had another key `eye_color` with the value `"brown"`, that would be perfectly fine.

```python
person = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York",
    "hair_color": "brown",
    "eye_color": "brown"  # This is perfectly fine
}
print(person)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York', 'hair_color': 'brown', 'eye_color': 'brown'}
```

## Accessing dictionary values

You can access the value associated with a specific key in a dictionary by using square brackets `[]` with the key inside the brackets.

let's say we want to access the `age` of the person in our `person` dictionary:

```python
person = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York",
    "hair_color": "brown"
}
print(person["age"])  # Output: 30
```

In this example, we accessed the value associated with the key `"age"` in the `person` dictionary, which is `30`.

You can also use the `get()` method to access dictionary values. This method is useful because it allows you to provide a default value if the key does not exist in the dictionary.

```python
person = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York",
    "hair_color": "brown"
}
print(person.get("age"))          # Output: 30
print(person.get("occupation", "Not specified"))  # Output: Not specified
```

In this example, we used the `get()` method instead of square brackets `[]` to access the value associated with the key `"age"`, which is `30`.
Then we tried to access the value for the key `"occupation"`, which does not exist in the dictionary.
Since we provided a default value of `"Not specified"`, that is what was returned.

## Modifying dictionary values

You can also modify the value associated with a specific key in a dictionary by using square brackets `[]` with the key inside the brackets and assigning a new value.

It's Alice's birthday and she just turned 31! Let's update her age in the `person` dictionary:
```python
person = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York",
    "hair_color": "brown"
}

person["age"] = 31  # Updating Alice's age
print(person)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 31, 'city': 'New York', 'hair_color': 'brown'}
```

In this example, we updated the value associated with the key `"age"` from `30` to `31`.

## Adding new key-value pairs

You can add new key-value pairs to a dictionary by using square brackets `[]` with the new key inside the brackets and assigning a value.
Let's say we want to add Alice's occupation to the `person` dictionary:

```python
person = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 31,
    "city": "New York",
    "hair_color": "brown"
}
person["occupation"] = "Engineer"  # Adding a new key-value pair
print(person)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 31, 'city': 'New York', 'hair_color': 'brown', 'occupation': 'Engineer'}
```

Notice how this is the same syntax we used to modify an existing key's value.

## Removing key-value pairs

You can remove key-value pairs from a dictionary using the `del` statement or the `pop()` method.
Let's remove key-value pairs from the `person` dictionary using both methods:

```python
person = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 31,
    "city": "New York",
    "hair_color": "brown",
    "occupation": "Engineer"
}

# Using del statement
del person["hair_color"]
print(person)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 31, 'city': 'New York', 'occupation': 'Engineer'}
# Using pop() method
occupation = person.pop("occupation")
print(person)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 31, 'city': 'New York'}
print(occupation)  # Output: Engineer
```
In this example, we first used the `del` statement to remove the key-value pair with the key `"hair_color"`.

Then we used the `pop()` method to remove the key-value pair with the key `"occupation"` and stored the removed value in the variable `occupation`.
