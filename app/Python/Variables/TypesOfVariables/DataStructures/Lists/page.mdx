# Lists

Lists are ordered collections of items. Lists are a type of data type in Python referred to as a data structure.

Items in a list can be of any data type, including numbers, strings, and even other lists.

## Creating a List

You can create a list by placing items inside square brackets `[]`, separated by commas.

```python
# Creating a list of integers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Creating a list of strings
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
# Creating a mixed list
mixed = [1, "apple", 3.14, True]
```

In the example above, you may have noticed that lists can contain items of different data types. 
Usually lists contain items of the same data type, but Python allows for mixed data types as well.

## Accessing List Items

You may be wondering how to access items in a list. You can do this by using the index of the item you want to access.

Be aware that the first item in a list has an index of `0`, the second item has an index of `1`, and so on.

To access an item in a list, you can use square brackets `[]` with the index of the item you want to access inside the brackets.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple
print(fruits[1])  # Output: banana
print(fruits[2])  # Output: cherry
```

You can also use negative indexing to access items from the end of the list. The last item has an index of `-1`, the second last item has an index of `-2`, and so on.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[-1])  # Output: cherry
print(fruits[-2])  # Output: banana
print(fruits[-3])  # Output: apple
```
## Modifying List Items

You can modify items in a list by accessing them using their index and assigning a new value like you would with a variable.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits[1] = "blueberry"  # Changing "banana" to "blue
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry']
```

## List Methods

Lists come with several built-in methods that allow you to manipulate and work with them easily. Here are some commonly used list methods:

- `append()`: Adds an item to the end of the list.
  
  ```python
  fruits = ["apple", "banana"]
  fruits.append("cherry")
  print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
  ```

- `remove()`: Removes the first occurrence of a specified item from the list.
  
  ```python
    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
    fruits.remove("banana")
    print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'cherry']
    ```
- `pop()`: Removes and returns the item at the specified index. If no index is specified, it removes and returns the last item.
    ```python
    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
    last_fruit = fruits.pop()
    print(last_fruit)  # Output: cherry
    print(fruits)      # Output: ['apple', 'banana']
    ```

- `insert()`: Inserts an item at a specified index.
    ```python
    fruits = ["apple", "banana"]
    fruits.insert(1, "cherry")  # Inserting "cherry" at index 1
    print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'cherry', 'banana']
    ```
<Callout type="info" title="Note about insert()">
Notice how the `insert()` method shifts the item currently at that position (if any) and any subsequent items to the right.
</Callout>

- `sort()`: Sorts the items in the list in ascending order.
    ```python
    numbers = [3, 1, 4, 2]
    numbers.sort()
    print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
    ```

You can sort by descending order by passing the <u>argument</u> `reverse=True` to the `sort()` method.

```python
numbers = [3, 1, 4, 2]
numbers.sort(reverse=True)
print(numbers)  # Output: [4, 3, 2, 1]
```

- `len()`: Returns the number of items in the list.
    ```python
    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
    print(len(fruits))  # Output: 3
    ```

These are just a few of the many methods available for lists in Python. You can explore more methods in the [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists).
