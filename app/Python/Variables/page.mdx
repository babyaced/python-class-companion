# What are Variables?

Variables are used to store information. This information can then be used throughout your code.
Below is an example of how to create a variable in Python:
```python
# Example of a variable in Python
age = 28
```

**age** is the variable name
**28** is the value assigned to the variable
The **=** (equals sign) is needed to assign the value to the variable.

So now we have declared a variable **age** that stores the value **28**. 
You can now use this variable in your code by simply referring to its name.

```python
# Using the variable
print(age)  # This will output: 28
```

Next we'll go over the different types of variables in Python.
