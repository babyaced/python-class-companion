# Match Case

The `match` statement in Python allows you to compare a value against a series of patterns and execute code based on which pattern matches.

Here's a simple example of how to use `match` and `case` statements:

Let's say we want to print a message based on the day of the week:

```python
day = "Monday"

match day:
    case "Monday":
        print("Start of the work week!")
    case "Wednesday":
        print("We're halfway through the week!")
    case "Friday":
        print("It's almost the weekend!")
    case _:
        print("Just another day.")
```

In this example, the `match` statement checks the value of the `day` variable against each `case`.

- If `day` is `"Monday"`, it prints "Start of the work week!"
- If `day` is `"Wednesday"`, it prints "We're halfway through the week!"
- If `day` is `"Friday"`, it prints "It's almost the weekend!"
- The `_` case is a wildcard that matches anything not covered by the previous cases, so it prints "Just another day." for any other value of `day`.

You can see in the above explanation that the `match` statement is similar to having multiple `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements, but it is much more readable and clean.
