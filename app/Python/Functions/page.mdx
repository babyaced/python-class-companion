# Functions

## What are functions?

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help you organize your code, make it more readable, and avoid repetition.

## Defining a function

You can define a function using the `def` keyword, followed by the name you want to give the function and parentheses. 

Here's an example of a simple function that greets a user:

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, welcome to Python!")
```

In this example, we defined a function named `greet` that prints a welcome message when called.

## Using a function (Calling a function)

Calling a function is done by using its name followed by parentheses:

```python
greet()  # Output: Hello, welcome to Python!
```

When you call a function the code inside the function is <u>executed</u>.

So in this example, calling `greet()` will print `Hello, welcome to Python!` to the console.

## Function Parameters

Functions can also take inputs, called <u>parameters</u>, which allow you to pass data into the function. 

Here's an example of a function that takes a parameter:

```python
def greet_user(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to Python!")
```

You can probably see how this would be useful! The `greet_user` function takes a parameter `name` and uses it to personalize the greeting message.

To call this function and pass a name, you would do it like this:

```python
greet_user("Alice")  # Output: Hello, Alice! Welcome to Python!
```

In this example, when we call `greet_user("Alice")`, it prints a personalized greeting for Alice: `Hello, Alice! Welcome to Python!`.

## Return Values

Functions can also return values using the `return` statement. 

When you return a value from a function, that means the function will give back a result that you can use later in your code.

To demonstrate this, here's an example of a function that adds two numbers and *returns* the result:

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b
```

You can call this function and store the returned value in a variable like this:

```python
result = add_numbers(3, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

In this example, the `add_numbers` function takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, adds them together, and returns the result. 

When we call `add_numbers(3, 5)`, it returns the result of `5+3` which is `8`. This value is then stored in the variable `result`. 

On the next line we print the value of `result`, which is 8.

You may be wondering why we would want to return a value instead of just printing it inside the function.

This is a valid question! Returning values from functions is most useful when you want to use the result of a function in other parts of your code, or when you want to perform further calculations with that result.

For example if you wanted to add two numbers and then multiply the result by another number, you could do it like this:

```python
sum_result = add_numbers(3, 5)  # sum_result will be 8
final_result = sum_result * 2    # final_result will be 16
print(final_result)               # Output: 16
```

Doing it this way also allows you to keep the addition and multiplication functionality separate, making your code more <u>modular</u> and easier to read.

Modularity is an important concept in programming that helps you break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces.

Its good practice to write functions that perform a single task and return results, as this makes your code more reusable. 

You'll learn the value of this as you progress in your programming journey!
