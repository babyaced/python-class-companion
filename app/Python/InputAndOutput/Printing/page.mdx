# Printing

In Python, you can print output to the console using the `print()` function.

It is one of the most commonly used functions in Python and something you will use frequently during this class.

## Basic printing

To print a simple message, you can use the `print()` function like this:

```python
# Example of basic printing
print("Hello, World!")
```

The *string* we want to print needs to be placed inside the parentheses and enclosed in quotes.

When you run this code, it will output:

```
Hello, World!
```

We are not limited to printing just strings though. We can also print numbers and other data types. For example:

```python
# Printing different data types
print(42)            # Printing an integer
print(3.14)         # Printing a float
print(True)         # Printing a boolean
```

This will output:

```
42
3.14
True
```

## Printing multiple items

You can also print multiple items at once by separating them with commas inside the `print()` function. For example:

```python
# Printing multiple items
name = "Alice"
age = 30
print("Name:", name, "Age:", age)
```

Here we are printing a string followed by the value of the variable `name`, then another string followed by the value of the variable `age`.

This will output:

```
Name: Alice Age: 30
```

When printing multiple items, Python automatically adds a space between each item. You can think of the comma turning into a space in the output.

These are basics of printing in Python. In the next section, you'll learn about more advanced printing techniques that will help you format your output better.
