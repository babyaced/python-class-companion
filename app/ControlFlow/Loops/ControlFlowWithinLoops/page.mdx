# Control Flow Within Loops

Just like we can use control flow statements like `if`, `else`, and `elif` to control the flow of our programs, we can also use them *within* loops to add more complex logic to our iterations.

## sing if statements within loops
You can use `if` statements inside loops to conditionally execute code during each iteration.
Here's an example of a `for` loop that prints only the even numbers from 1 to 10:

```python
for number in range(1, 11):
    if number % 2 == 0:  # Check if the number is even
        print(number)
```

In this example, the loop iterates through numbers 1 to 10. Inside the loop, we use an `if` statement to check if the number is even (i.e., divisible by 2 with no remainder). If the condition is true, it prints the number.

When you run this code, it will output:

```
2
4
6
8
10
```

In general, you can do anything inside a loop that you can do outside of a loop, including using control flow statements like `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

However, there are also some special control flow statements that are specifically designed to work within loops: `break` and `continue`. We'll cover those next!

## The break statement

The `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely or early, stopping all further iterations.
We typically use `break` when we want to stop the loop based on a certain condition being met, that no longer requires further iterations.

Here's an example of using `break` in a `while` loop:

```python
number_we_are_looking_for = 7
current_number = 1
while current_number <= 10:
    if current_number == number_we_are_looking_for:
        print("Found the number: {current_number}")
        break  # Exit the loop when we find the number, we don't need to keep looking!
    print("Checking number: {current_number}")
    current_number += 1 # Increment current_number by 1
```

In this example, the loop iterates through numbers 1 to 10. When it finds the number we are looking for (7), it prints a message and then uses `break` to exit the loop immediately because we no longer need to continue searching.

When you run this code, it will output:

```
Checking number: 1
Checking number: 2
Checking number: 3
Checking number: 4
Checking number: 5
Checking number: 6
Found the number: 7
```

This was a very simple example, but `break` can be very useful in more complex loops where you want to stop iterating based on certain conditions.

## The continue statement

The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration.
We typically use `continue` when we want to skip over certain items in a loop based on a condition, but still want to keep iterating through the rest of the items.

Here's an example of using `continue` in a `for` loop:

```python
for number in range(1, 11):
    if number % 2 != 0:  # Check if the number is odd
        continue  # Skip odd numbers
    print(number)  # This will only print even numbers
```

In this example, the loop iterates through numbers 1 to 10. When it encounters an odd number, it uses `continue` to skip the rest of the loop body for that iteration and move on to the next number. As a result, only even numbers are printed.

When you run this code, it will output:

```
2
4
6
8
10
```

Continue is basically a way to say "skip this one and go to the next" within a loop.

## Summary

That's it for control flow within loops! Try using `if`, `else`, `elif`, `break`, and `continue` to create more complex and dynamic loops in your Python programs.
