# loops

In the previous lesson, we learned about conditional statements using `if`, `elif`, and `else` to control whether certain blocks of code run at all.

Another aspect of control flow is controlling *how many times* a block of code runs. This is where **loops** come in!

## What are loops?

Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times until a certain condition is met.

There are two main types of loops in Python: `while` loops and `for` loops.

## While loops

A `while` loop repeats a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.

Here's an example of a `while` loop that prints numbers from 1 to 5:

```python
number_of_iterations = 1
while number_of_iterations <= 5:
    print(number_of_iterations)
    number_of_iterations += 1  # Increment number_of_iterations by 1
```

In this example, the loop continues to run as long as `number_of_iterations` is less than or equal to 5. Inside the loop, we print the value of `i` and then increment `i` by 1.

<Callout type="note" title="Vocab - Iteration">
    In programming, each time a loop runs through its block of code is called an **iteration**.
</Callout>

When you run this code, it will output:

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

## For loops

A `for` loop lets you repeat a block of code for each item in a sequence (like a list or a range of numbers).

Here's an example of a `for` loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 5:

```python
for number_of_iterations in range(1, 6):
    print(number_of_iterations) # Code you want to repeat
```

The range() function generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to 5 and the loop **iterates** over each number, assigning it to the variable `i` and executing the indented block of code (printing `i`) for each number.

When you run this code, it will output:

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

Notice how we got the same output as the `while` loop example, but we never needed to manually increment `number_of_iterations` or check the condition ourselves. The `for` loop handles that for us!

In other programming languages, `for` loops often use a different **syntax** that demonstrates this more clearly, but in Python, the `for` loop is designed to be simple and easy to read.
