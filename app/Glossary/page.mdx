*Keyword*: A word reserved by a programming language that has a special meaning and cannot be used as an identifier (ie. variable name, function name, etc.). Examples include `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, `def`, `class`, etc.

*Identifier*: A name used to identify a variable, function, class, or other user-defined item in a programming language. Identifiers must follow specific rules (such as starting with a letter or underscore and not containing spaces) and cannot be the same as keywords.

*Variable*: A named storage location in a program that holds a value. Variables can be assigned different values throughout the execution of a program.

*Function*: A reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions can take input parameters and return output values.

*Class*: A blueprint for creating objects in object-oriented programming. A class defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.

*Object*: An instance of a class that contains data and can perform actions defined by the class's methods. "Object" is a more general term that can refer to any entity in programming.

*Instance*: A specific object created from a class. Each instance can have its own unique values for the properties defined in the class. We usually use the term "instance" to refer to an object when we want to emphasize that it is a specific occurrence of a class. 

*Attribute*: A variable that belongs to an object or class. Attributes hold data that describes the object or class.

*Method*[#]: A function that belongs to an object or class.
