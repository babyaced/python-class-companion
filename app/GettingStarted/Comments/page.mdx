# Comments

Throughout the code examples in this course, you may have noticed lines that start with the `#` symbol. These are called **comments**.

```python
# This is a comment in Python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Comments are used to add explanations or notes to your code. They are ignored by the Python interpreter, which means they do not affect how the program runs.

Comments are included in these code examples for instructional purposes. However, in general, you should not get in the habit of writing comments in your code. There are a couple of reasons for this.

## Why You Should Avoid Writing Comments in Your Code

**1. If your code is well-written and self-explanatory, you shouldn't need comments to understand what it does. In fact, comments can sometimes make code harder to read if they are not used properly.**

This an example of code that is not self-explanatory and would require comments to understand:
```python
# p is the price of the item
p = 20

# r is the sales tax rate (7%)
r = 0.07

# t is the amount of tax
t = p * r

# f is the final total price
f = p + t

# print the final total
print(f)
```

This is that same code but written in a more self-explanatory way that does not require comments:
```python
price = 20
sales_tax_rate = 0.07
tax_amount = price * sales_tax_rate
final_total = price + tax_amount
print(final_total)
```

See how the second version is actually more concise and easier to understand without needing comments to explain what each variable represents?

Usually creating clear and self-explanatory code is simply a matter of choosing good variable and function names, and organizing your code in a logical way. This is a much better approach than relying on comments to explain your code.

**2. Comments can become outdated or incorrect if you change your code but forget to update the comments. This can lead to confusion for anyone reading your code later on.**

Imagine that code now is supposed to calculate the final total price after applying a discount, but you forget to update the comments:

```python
# p is the price of the item
p = 20

# r is the sales tax rate (7%)
r = 0.20

# t is the amount of tax
t = p * r

# f is the final total price
f = p - t

# print the final total
print(f)
```

Now the comments are misleading and incorrect, which can cause confusion for anyone reading the code later on. They might think that the code is either:
- supposed to calculate the final total price after applying sales tax, but there is a bug in the code where it is actually applying a discount instead
- supposed to calculate the final total price after applying a discount, but there is a bug in the code where it is actually applying sales tax instead

## When Comments Can Be Useful

However, there are a few edge cases where comments can be helpful:

**1. To explain why you are doing something in a certain way or making a specific decision, especially if it's not immediately obvious from the code itself.**

```python
age = 16

# Add 1 because the form asks for the age the student will turn this year
age = age + 1

print(age)
```

Here we are using a comment to explain a choice that seems a bit odd (adding 1 to the age) that might not be immediately obvious to someone reading the code. This can help prevent confusion and make it clear why we are doing something in a certain way.

**2. To temporarily disable a line of code while testing or debugging (this is called "commenting out" code). However this should be done only for short-term testing and should not be left in your final code.**

```python
# This line of code is commented out and will not run
# print("This line is commented out and will not be executed")
print("This line will be executed")
```

If you do need to use comments, make sure you have a plan to keep them up to date and ensure they add value to your code rather than just cluttering it.
