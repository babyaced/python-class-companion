# Project 2: Data Explorer

## Stage 1: Lists
    - Learning Objective: Get comfortable with creating lists and list elements and accessing and modifying list elements.
    - Tasks:
        - Create a list of movie titles, ratings, and genres
        - Create a function to access and modify elements in the list
        - Create a function to add new movies to the list
    - Topics Covered:
        - [Lists](../../Variables/TypesOfVariables/DataStructures/Lists)
- Stage 2: Loops
    - Learning Objective: Get comfortable using loops to loop through lists and perform operations
    - Write a loop to print each movie title from the list
    - Use a loop to calculate the sum of ratings in the list
    - Tasks:
        - Exercise 1: Create a loop that prints both the movie title and its rating from a list.
        - Exercise 2: Write a loop to find the highest-rated movie in the list
        - Exercise 3: Create a loop that filters the movies by genre and stores them in a new list
    - Topics Covered:
        - [Loops](../../ControlFlow/Loops)
        - [Math Operations](../../Variables/TypesOfVariables/NumericTypes)
- Stage 3: 
    - Exercise 1: Write a function calculate_average_rating that takes a list of ratings and returns the average
    - Exercise 2: Write a function find_highest_rated that takes a list of movies and uses a loop to find the highest-rated movie
    - Topics Covered:
        - [Functions](../../Functions)
        - [Math Operations](../../Variables/TypesOfVariables/NumericTypes)
- Stage 4: Reading movie data from Files
    - Task 1: Write a function load_movies that reads movie data from a file and inserts the movies into a list
    - Task 2: Write a function `save_analysis(results,filename) that saves analysis results (average ratings, genre summaries) to a text file
    - Task 3: Practice reading a movie dataset from a file and processing it using the functions created earlier
    - Topics Covered:
        - [Handling Files](../../InputAndOutput/HandlingFiles)
        - [Functions](../../Functions)

The final application should load a movie dataset from a file, analyze it using hte functions (calculate average rating, find the highest-rated movie, etc.) and save the results to a new file
