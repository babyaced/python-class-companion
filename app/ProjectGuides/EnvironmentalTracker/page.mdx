# Project 1: Environmental Tracker

For this project, you’ll create a simple Python program to track your environmental impact, focusing on the water used for showers. 
You’ll get introduced to basic Python concepts like input/output, variables, constants, and simple calculations.

## Stage 1: Input and Output

- Learning Objective: Get comfortable with capturing user input and displaying output.
- Tasks:
    - Write code that prompts the user to enter the number of showers they take in a week and store this value in a variable.
    - Write code that prompts the user to enter how long their average shower lasts (in minutes) and store this value in another variable.
    - Display the total number of showers and average shower duration on the screen for the user.
- Topics covered:
    - [User Input](../../InputAndOutput/UserInput)
    - [Output](../../InputAndOutput/Output)

## Stage 2: Constants and Calculations
- Learning Objective: Know when to use constants and perform basic calculations.
- Tasks: 
    - Define a constant for average water usage per shower.
      - Look up the average water usage per minute for a showerhead (in gallons or liters) online.
    - Calculate the total water usage for the week based on the variables you stored in Stage 1 and the constant.
- Topics covered:
    - [Variables](../Variables)
    - [Constants](../Variables#Constants)
    - [Calculations with Numbers](../../Variables/TypesOfVariables/NumericTypes)
    - [Type Conversions](../Variables/TypeConversions)

## Stage 3: Formatting Output
- Learning Objective: Learn how to format output for better readability.
- Tasks:
    - Use Python's string formatting to label the water consumption results
- Topics Covered:
    - [String Formatting](../InputAndOutput/FormattingOutput/page.mdx)

## Stage 4: Project Completion and Reflection
- Learning Objective: Wrap up the project and reflect on what you've learned.
- Tasks:
    - Test your program with different inputs to make sure it works correctly.
    - Reflect on how tracking water usage can help people reduce their environmental impact.
- Topics Covered:
    - [Testing and Debugging](../DebuggingAndTesting/Testing/page.mdx)]
