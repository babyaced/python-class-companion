# Project 3: Generative Art
In this project, you will create a simple generative art program using Python.

# Stage 1: Setting up your Project Environment
- Learning Objective: Get comfortable with setting up a Python project environment
- Tasks:
    - Install Pillow library for image creation and manipulation.
- Topics Covered:
    - [Setting up Python Environment](../../GettingStarted/SettingUpPythonEnvironment/page.mdx)
    - [Installing Packages with pip](../../GettingStarted/InstallingPackages/page.mdx)

# Stage 2: Creating the ArtElement class
- Learning Objective: Learn how to create a class to represent an individual object.
- Tasks:
    - Define a class named `ArtElement` that will represent a basic shape in your generative art.
        - Define attributes for position, height, width, and color.
        - Create a constructor method (`__init__`) that initializes the attributes of the class.
        - create a method called `draw` that will draw the shape onto an image canvas.
- Topics Covered:
    - [Classes and Objects](../../Variables/TypesOfVariables/DataStructures/Objects/page.mdx)

# Stage 3: Creating the Canvas Class
- Learning Objective: Learn how to create a class that manages a collection of objects.
- Tasks:
    - Define a class named `Canvas` that will represent your digital canvas.
        - Define attributes for height, width, and background color.
        - Create a constructor method that will create a blank image with a specified height, width, and background color.
        - Write a method called `add_element` that takes an `ArtElement` object as a parameter and draws it onto the canvas.
        - Create a method called `render` that loops through the stored `ArtElement` objects and calls their `draw` method to render them onto the canvas.
- Topics Covered:
    - [Classes and Objects](../../Variables/TypesOfVariables/DataStructures/Objects/page.m
    - [Loops](../../ControlFlow/Loops/page.mdx)

# Stage 4: Composing and Generating Art
- Create a function:
    - that creates a `Canvas` object
    - Generates multiple `ArtElement` objects with random attributes (position, size, color)
    - Adds them to the canvas
    - Render the final image and save it to a file.
- Topics Covered:
    - [Loops](../../ControlFlow/Loops/page.mdx)
    - [Random Module](../../Modules/StandardLibrary/Random/page.mdx)
